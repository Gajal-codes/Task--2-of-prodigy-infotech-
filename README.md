# 🚢 Task-02: Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & EDA
**Internship:** Prodigy Infotech (Data Science)  
**Intern:** Gajal Sharma  
**Platform:** Google Colab  

---

## 📌 Objective
To perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset to uncover survival patterns and relationships in the data.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Filled missing values in `age` using the median
- Filled missing `embarked` values using the mode
- Dropped the `deck` column (too many missing values)
- Dropped rows with remaining null values
- Removed duplicate rows

---

## 📊 EDA Visualizations
1. **Survival Count**
2. **Survival by Gender**
3. **Survival by Passenger Class**
4. **Age Distribution**
5. **Correlation Heatmap**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 🚺 **Women** had a much higher survival rate than men
- 🎟️ **1st Class** passengers had better chances of survival
- 📈 Most passengers were between **20–40 years old**
- 💸 Survival was positively correlated with **fare paid**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📁 Files Included
- `Task-02-Titanic-EDA.ipynb` – Colab Notebook with code, visualizations, and insights
- `README.md` – Summary of the project

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis revealed strong influences of **gender, class, and fare** on survival rates. The project helped understand the power of data visualization and preprocessing in real-world datasets.
